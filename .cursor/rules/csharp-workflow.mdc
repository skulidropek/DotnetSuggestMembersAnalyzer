# C# Project Workflow

When working with C# projects, always follow these guidelines:

- **Code Formatting and Linting**:
  - Run `dotnet format` to automatically format code and resolve basic linting issues.

- **Building the Project**:
  - Execute `dotnet build` to ensure the project compiles without errors.

- **Running Tests (if available)**:
  - Run `dotnet test` to verify that the project functions correctly and tests pass successfully.

- **Additional Recommendations**:
  - Utilize Roslyn analyzers and SecurityCodeScan for static code analysis and security auditing.
